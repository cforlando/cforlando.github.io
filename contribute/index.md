Here's how we work.

1. politely, in aggregate with the rest of the group, request data,
2. use data and make it better,
3. contribute data back,
4. build things and a build a reputation for open-data success.

We think it's our task to use public data in novel ways. One obstacle is that
leaving data hidden in a (metaphorical) vault is much easier than building a
way to present it to the world.

We nurture personal relationships with many members of local governments, and
that is the way most progress is made. If you want data you dont yet have,
*please* come to a meeting and get our help. It hurts the cause of open
government to burden members of the government, and we know the right people to
talk to, to minimize annoyance.

----

We would like to keep our projects in the umbrella of this project on Github.
You're under no obligation, of course, but a ever-growing suite of projects are
a good demonstration in the ecosystem that grows around open government.
Tangible, visible benfits are the best advertizing we have.

We'll be happy to create teams and repos however you like. Please help us keep
a sensible naming scheme. Plan for the next decade of projects after yours.

----

We are not only going to consume data, but if we do it right, we will be
generating it too. It would be nice to plan to be able to give data back to the
municipality that is better than what we received.

----

Next, build it. Please work in the open, and steward your project responsibly.
Lots of Code for Orlando members are not experienced coders, but interested
laymen or people cutting their teeth for the first time. Go out of your way to
make it easy for everyone to help.
