The names of Code for Orlando and Code for America lead with a word that
intimidates plenty of people who are interested in civic improvement. It
shouldn't.

Code for Orlando is bigger than computers and programming, and we need
all kinds of skills outside of anything a sane person would call "code".

At the 2015 Day of Civic Hacking, we had a session about the flag for the
City of Orlando. The city has some great iconography around its seal and
logo, but those are not flags, and we are operating with a flag that almost
no one is happy with. 

A flag should symbolize our city to ourselves and our selves to the world.
It's a device around which, though out history, people have literally 
rallied, to act as a group and feel like part of something bigger than 
themselves.

Other cities have flags that hang in front of businesses and off of front
porches. They are patches sewn onto backpacks. The drape over beds. 
They forment pride and inspire.

Not having the same, is the kind of problem that Code for Orlando can help
solve, and it doesn't involve computer-science degrees.

As of July 2015, designing a flag is not yet done. We have some good ideas, but
we need you. 

Join us and help us make Orlando, and cities and counties around it, better.
