What's stopping you from coming to your first hack-night and getting started on a project? Perhaps you'd like to know a few things.

Why Code for Orlando exists
===========================

Compared to huge rich tech companies and young exciting startups, government civic-service is not good at attracting tech talent. 

That's a problem. Government is the common "platform" we all share, and it's in our interest to make things better. Code for America is "[a Peace-Corps for geeks](https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_pahlka_coding_a_better_government)", and Code for Orlando is a "brigade" inside it that focuses on Orlando and its surroundings.

The people in Code for Orlando are volunteers, each working on whatever we care about, aiming to use our technical talents to make a difference for the better. At hack-nights, hack-days, or hack-fests, we meet in person to synchronize efforts, rally support, spark new ideas, and get help.

We have officers that help grease the organizational gears, but projects and decisions are not dictated from the top. *You* define what you want to work on. Your active involvement and stewardship of code gives you authority over it.

Get going
=========

Our immediate goal is to get stuff done. Our anti-goal is waiting for permission. Your marching orders, should you join us: Make things that are useful. Act like you're the best person for the job, until you have a reason to think otherwise. Think of your audience. Ask for help when you need it. Leave things better than the way you found it.

That's it. [Come to our next hack-night](http://www.meetup.com/Code-For-Orlando/) and get your idea started or help some place that needs you. And we do. We need you.
