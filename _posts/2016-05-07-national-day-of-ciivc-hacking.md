Code for America brigades are pretty independent, but one day per year, they coordinate a massive event spanning several dozen
cities. Here's what to expect at the National Day of Civic Hacking, and why you should come.

Typically, about 100 people gather downtown with their laptops, pencils, and notepads, and we work from morning to evening.
It goes in four phases:

First, we say hi and write ideas on cards, and form some loose consensus about where we should spend our time. Here is where
you should be bold with an idea, if you have one to give. There's nothing to prepare for here, except to have an idea of
what kinds of talents you want to ask for from the people around you.

Second, we have a lightning-fast selection, where people's interest decides what gets done. You vote with your feet, and go to what 
idea you like. Ideas with enough people go to a room or table, and that leads to the long phase, of working on it. Have a goal
in mind for the day, and work toward it. Code for Orlando is is surprisingly informal, and since we're all volunteers no one is coerced into boring projects. At
the National Day of Civic Hacking, you can move around all you like, or sit alone in a corner.

Deadline and presentations come near the end. We gather back in the common space and show off what we accomplished that day.
You should be thinking about this part during your work earlier. It might be better to pick a bite-sized chunk and complete
it, instead of partial work on lots of facets of a big idea.

Finally, we relax and get to know each other better. This probably means a tasty after-work beverage and chatting. People 
will have questions about the project you worked on, and there will be plenty of people you didn't meet in the morning time.

It's kind of exhilarating to start a new project in the morning that you pick; and work with awesome, caring people all 
day; and have something made in the afternoon that benefits our community. You should join us.
