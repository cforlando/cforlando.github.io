What is this?
=============

Code for Orlando, a local 
[Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/about/values/) brigade,
brings the community together to improve Orlando through technology. We are a
group of "civic hackers" from various disciplines who are committed to
volunteering our talents to make a difference in the local community. We unite
to improve the way the community, visitors, and local government experience
Orlando.

We welcome you to bring your talents to create a better Orlando

Jennifer Pahlka, in her 2012 TED talk, called it "a Peace Corps for geeks."

Some words to describe us:  transparent, inclusive, respectful, permissionless,
generative.
