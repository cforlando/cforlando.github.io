Help make Orlando better
========================

Code for Orlando is a group of "civic hackers" who volunteer our tech
talents to improve Orlando through our expertise in technology. We unite to
improve the way residents, visitors, and local government experience Orlando.

Like what? Whatever we think of. We have some neat projects already, spanning
topics like pet adoption, bicycling, walking tours, road closures, and public
health and vaccination.

In her 2012 TED talk, Jennifer Pahlka called our parent organization 
([Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/about/values/)) "a
Peace Corps for geeks".

Some words to describe us:  transparent, inclusive, respectful, permissionless,
generative.  You [don't even have to be a programmer!](/2015/07/30/flags/) We
need all kinds of talent, so please don't let the "code" in our name scare you.

**We need you and your skills. Together, we can make Orlando more awesome.**

How can you help?
=================

Join us.  Don't worry -- there's no commitment here.

We're not at all formal, but we do get together once a month (at least) to
[chat about what we're interested in trying, or stuck on, or see a need for.](/2016/02/01/your-first-hacknight/)
If you're not sure what to do, just come listen. We have 
[a Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Code-For-Orlando/) 
we use to advertize events.

Dive into a project
===================

We think you should come to some meetings, yes, but we're not all talk.  Maybe
you already know what you want to do. Maybe you want to explore and jump
straight to the code. 

Check out [all of our code](https://github.com/cforlando/) and some of 
[the data we've accumulated](https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/brigade?brigade=Code%20for%20Orlando).

We also have some bug reports that we've marked as a good place to look for a
way to help. Those are marked "help wanted" in 
[each project](https://github.com/cforlando/)'s issue tracker.
