What is this?
=============

Code for Orlando, a local 
[Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/about/values/) brigade,
brings the community together to improve Orlando through technology. We are a
group of "civic hackers" from various disciplines who are committed to
volunteering our talents to make a difference in the local community. We unite
to improve the way the community, visitors, and local government experience
Orlando.

Jennifer Pahlka, in her 2012 TED talk, called Code for America "a
Peace Corps for geeks".

Some words to describe us:  transparent, inclusive, respectful, permissionless,
generative.

We want you to bring your talents to create a better Orlando.

How can you help?
=================

Join us.  Don't worry -- there's no commitment here.

We're not at all formal, but we do get together once a month (at least) to
chat about what we're interested in trying, or stuck on, or see a need for.  If
you're not sure what to do, just [come listen. We have a Meetup
group](http://www.meetup.com/Code-For-Orlando/) we use to advertize events.
