Help make Orlando better
========================

Code for Orlando is a loose group of *civic hackers* who volunteer our tech
talents to improve our city for residents, visitors, and local government.

In her 2012 TED talk, Jennifer Pahlka described 
[us](https://www.codeforamerica.org/about/values/) as "a
Peace Corps for geeks". Instead of digging wells, we might sift reams of government
data to report water quality in a way citizens can understand.
<span class="videoframe"><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_pahlka_coding_a_better_government">See the whole talk.</a> It's pretty great.</span><!--- link to video shows up only when narrow screen -->

We've made projects to help people adopt pets, bicycle around, take walking tours, 
know of road closures, and be healthy and vaccinated, and *whatever else we think 
of.* We're sure you will have ideas too.

We're transparent, inclusive, respectful, permissionless, and generative, and we'd 
like you to join us. You [don't even have to be a programmer!](/2015/07/30/flags/) We
need all kinds of talent, so please don't let the "code" in our name scare you.

**We need you and your skills. Together, we can make Orlando more awesome.**

How can you help?
=================

At the very least, you should introduce yourself on our Slack group. Slack is how we communicate
most. <span class="attention-block"><script async defer src="https://codefororlando.herokuapp.com/slackin.js?large"></script></span>

You may like to come to a meeting, too. We get together to chat about what we're
interested in trying, or stuck on, or see a need for.
[If you're not sure what to do](/2016/02/01/your-first-hacknight/), come listen. We have 
[a Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Code-For-Orlando/) 
we use to advertize events.

<ul id="upcoming-meetup-events"></ul><!--- This is programatically filled. -->


Dive into a project
===================

Meetings are useful to coordinate with other people, but you don't have to wait.
Maybe you already know what you want to do. Maybe you want to explore and jump
straight to the code. 

Check out [all of our code](https://github.com/cforlando/) and some of 
[the data we've accumulated](https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/brigade?brigade=Code%20for%20Orlando).

We also have some bug reports that we've marked as a good place to look for a
way to help. Those are marked "starter" in 
[each project](https://github.com/cforlando/)'s issue tracker.

<ul id="help-needed-bugs"></ul><!--- This is programatically filled. -->
